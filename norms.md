Our norms

Meetings:
Stand up in the morning
Meet again after lunch
As the project nears the end, meet at the end of that day as well (5:45)

When there are disagreements:
With two people disagreeing consult rest of the group
Otherwise, consult a fellow or Dan/John

When a group member is frustrated:
BE KIND
Talk one on one with that individual
Then go to the rest of the group

TAKE BREAKS

For merging:
Talk to each other before every merge
Request everyone as a reviewer for a merge
Merge everyday after 5:45 meeting (unless needed earlier)

Asking for help:
After googling/stack overflow provides no help, ask for a second set of eyes

Pair programming:
Decide on the norms as each pair programs together

After Hours:
Only continue a task you were doing earlier after hours, but don't start something new without consulting the group
Otherwise, communicate via Slack and make sure to assign yourself on the issue!
Assume someone is NOT free if you haven't checked first. 

Stand Up Time:
Every morning after REACTO, but also throughout the day if we feel the need.
